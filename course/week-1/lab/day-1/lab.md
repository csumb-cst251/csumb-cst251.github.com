Lab numero uno
==============

Today we are going to first gather some information about you so we can build some student teams next week and know a little about you. It's OK if you don't know the answers to all the questions on the survey.

Things to do
------------


- Create a free account on [GitHub]().
- Complete the [student survey]() and make sure to enter your GitHub account name.
- If you have brought your own computer, download and install the GitHub for [Mac]() or [Windows]().

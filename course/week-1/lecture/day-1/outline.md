Outline of lecture 1
====================

This is the first course, so it'll be mostly covering the syllabus, answering questions, gathering information from the students.

- Go over the syllabus.
- Introduction of the faculty.
- Talk about the **harsh realities of life** as a web developer: your degree won't get you a job, only experience and skill will get you a job.
- Discuss the plagiarism issue - what is considered OK to copy-paste, what isn't.
- Quick overview of version control. What is it?

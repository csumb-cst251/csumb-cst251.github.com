Week 1: Intro to Git and basic HTML
===================================

This is the only week where we won't be pretending you are working for a client. Instead we want you to cut your chops on Git and be comfortable with making commits and comments. There will also be a tiny bit of HTML work for you to do.

Please do the following:

1. Create an account on GitHub (you can use whatever user name you want), and email me with your username (let's email kemiller+yaygit@csumb.edu so I can file these quickly). I will email you back when you've been added to the course.
2. Go to https://github.com/csumb-cst251/csumb-cst251.github.com and click the **Fork** button up top. Make your fork private.
3. Add a file called `yaygit.txt` to the `project` folder inside this week's folder.
4. Add some text - maybe some [hipster ipsum](hipsteripsum.me) to that file. Commit that change.
5. Make some changes to the file. Commit that change with a comment that mentions me "@kevee".
6. Push your changes to GitHub.

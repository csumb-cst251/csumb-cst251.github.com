Building your team
==================

For the rest of the course, you will be assigned to teams of five to six people, and each team will represent a real company that designs and develops websites for clients. During lab, work with your new team to do some research on your assigned company. Visit their website. Check out their profile pages and imagine your face in there amongst the nerds and artists that build the web. Look up their portfolios

Assignment
----------

Have one of your team members open a new fork of the course in GitHub, and create a new file with the name of your company in the format `name.md`, and place that file in the `teams` folder.

In this file, enter a paragraph or two description of the company answering the following questions:

- How big is the company? Roughly how many people work there?
- What type of clients does the firm work for?
- What's the work environment? Is everyone telecommuting, or is there a central office? Does their office have foosball?
- Are they hiring? `;)`

After the paragraph, enter a list of the people who are on your team, including their name and GitHub username (preceeded by an `@` symbol), as well as their role (designer, developer, project manager, or just "jack/jill-of-all-trades"). Since this is a "markdown" file, it will be formatted for you automagically, just enter it like the example below:

    - Joe Otter @joeotter - Designer
    - Jane Otter @janeotter - Developer
    - Poject Porpoise @iluvzmeprojects - Project manager
    - Swiss-army D'knife @icandoeverything - Jack of all trades

    Many a land-lubber be thinkin' that the kraken be posessin' some kind of fur, and can be taught to sit, play a-fetch, and wilst allow a nice belly rubbin'. Nigh! The kraken be none of those things! It be a <strong>terrible creature</strong> with fifteen hundred arms and ten thousand eyes. If you be a-seein' a kraken in yer neighboarhood, do not be attempting to feed it table scraps and teach it tricks.

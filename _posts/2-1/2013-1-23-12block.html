<p>Paragraphs and headers are block elements.</p>

<h2>See? Block element!</h2>

<p>This paragraph is a block element with some <strong>inline elements</strong> that follow the text. Note that this image <img src="/common/images/kogepan.png" alt="My dog, Kogepan!" /> is also totally an inline element.</p>

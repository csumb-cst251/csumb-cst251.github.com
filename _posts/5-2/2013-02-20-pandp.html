        <p><span class="intro">The</span> next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form.</p>

        <p>"May I hope, <span class="madam">Madam</span>, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"</p>

        <p>Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a <span class="blush">blush of surprise</span>, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,</p>

        <p class="quote">"<strong>Oh dear</strong>! -- Yes -- certainly. -- I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection. -- Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,</p>

        <p class="quote">"Dear Ma'am, do not go. -- I beg you will not go. -- Mr. Collins must excuse me. -- He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear. I am going away myself."</p>

        <p>To such perseverance in wilful self-deception, Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the <strong class="affection">affectation and coquetry of an elegant female</strong>.</p>

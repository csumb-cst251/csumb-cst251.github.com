    <h2>History of lorem ipsum</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum was invented by Se&ntilde;or Lorenium Ipsumorium in 1806 when fighting in the Napoleonic wars. By sending random latin jibberish in personal correspondence, he confounded Napoleon so much that he lost the Battle of Trafalgar.</p>
    <p>Se&ntilde;or Ipsumorium is buried in Leeds and his headstone reads "Lorem Ipsum: nihil dicit, dicit omnia."</p>

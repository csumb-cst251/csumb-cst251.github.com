  <p><strong>OSWALD</strong> What dost thou know me for?</p>
  <p><strong>KENT</strong>
    A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
    base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,      <br/>
    hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a   <br/>
    lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,     <br/>
    glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;     <br/>
    one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a  <br/>
    bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but  <br/>
    the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,<br/>
    and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I<br/>
    will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest  <br/>
    the least syllable of thy addition.                <br/>
  </p>
  <p><strong> OSWALD
    Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail<br/>
    on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
  </p>

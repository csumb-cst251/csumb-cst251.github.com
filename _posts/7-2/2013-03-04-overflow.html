  <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
  <p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Don't underestimate the Force. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
  <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Red Five standing by. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
  <p>Red Five standing by. Don't underestimate the Force. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
